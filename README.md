Eyevinn Open Analytics is an open source solution for tracking events from video players. Based on the open standard Eyevinn Player Analytics ([EPAS](https://github.com/Eyevinn/player-analytics-specification/tree/main)) it enables a modular framework where you are not locked in with a specific vendor. This is the eventsink module that receives and validate the data from the players and push the data on to a processing quque.

## Hosted Solution

Available as an open web service in [Eyevinn Open Source Cloud](https://www.osaas.io). Read this [documentation to quickly get started](https://docs.osaas.io/osaas.wiki/Service%3A-Player-Analytics-Eventsink.html) with the hosted solution.

## Development

The simplest way to run an eventsink locally is to use the fastify service, by running `npm start`. This will spin up a local server at port 3000 which you can use as eventsink url in your [Eyevinn Player Analytics Client SDK](https://github.com/Eyevinn/player-analytics-client-sdk-web) project. You may as well specify your environment variables as the standard specifies.

e.g. `QUEUE_TYPE=redis npm start` will start a `fastify` service towards your local `redis` as queue.

## Environment Variables

```bash
QUEUE_TYPE = "<SQS | beanstalkd | redis>"
HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL = "<heartbeat-interval>"
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = "<comma-separated-list-of-origins-to-allow>"

# AWS (Lambda & SQS) specifics
AWS_REGION = "<your-aws-region>"
# SQS specifics
SQS_QUEUE_URL = "<your-sqs-queue-url>"

# Redis specifics
REDIS_HOST = "<default localhost>"
REDIS_PORT = "<default 6379>"
REDIS_PASSWORD = "<default empty>"
```
